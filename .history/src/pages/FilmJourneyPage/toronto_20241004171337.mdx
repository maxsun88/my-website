### Toronto - a brand new start
After all the shitty experience in Montreal, I desperately needed a change. After graduation, I found a job in Toronto as a software developer and I immediately moved.

### 48 Hour Film Project
A brand new start means everything has to start from zero again. That’s something I’m not afraid of.

Usually, we tend to wait for a great idea to appear in our brain like a bolt of lightning that strikes. But this rarely happens. In fact, if you keep waiting, thinking you might do it one day you might put it off forever. I know I’m exactly like that.

So I thought the best way to kickstart my film career in Toronto was to participate in a competition. A deadline is always the best motivator. After looking online, I found out about 48 Hour Film Project - in which you write, shoot, and edit a film in just two days. This is a competition that I recommend every filmmaker to practice with.

After my big failure in directing the last short film, I decided not to direct this one, instead, to be a producer and find some directors to work with so I could learn from them. 

20 days before the competition, I started building the team. The first person was Noah, just a guy I know from my church who is a writer. Then I started posting in the Facebook groups for all the key members. In Toronto, talented people are everywhere. The crew members joined one by one. As we were getting closer to the date, we were still missing a DP. I was getting a little bit anxious about that.

All of a sudden, one day a French guy from Paris reached out to me on Instagram. To this day, I don’t know how he found me. This guy, Ozzy, seems like a very sick videographer. So I asked straight ahead if he’d like to help out with our 48-hour film. He happily said yes and I couldn’t believe that he owned a RED V-Raptor camera (at least 40,000$ worth) and tons of other gear. When I gave him a call, I found out he was in Paris. So he actually flew over to Toronto 2 days before the shoot and brought in a studio of equipment on the day of.

Two weeks before the competition, I got a heavy cold which I later knew was Covid. With a heavy fever, my brain was getting delusional. I somehow still managed to arrange the shoot, all thanks to the things I learned in Montreal.

Even tho the product we made wasn’t the best, we definitely had lots of fun doing this competition. It made me very glad that some of the cast said “This was the safest environment I’d felt on a film set”. That meant a lot to me as I wanted to do a better job than how it was for Latte Art.

### A Wild Drive
Brayden, one of the directors of the 48-hour film told me that he would like to participate in another competition soon afterward, with mainly the same team. I was still the producer on this one.

For this film, what I remembered most was not the filmmaking part.

We ended up choosing one of our crew member’s homes as the location. Apparently that was always the cheapest way. But that place was 40 km away from downtown Toronto where most of us live. 

We decided to rent a van - and it seemed like I was the only candidate who could be the driver. That was HUGE for me as had almost 0 driving experience after I got my license the year before. The 7 people who I needed to pick up had to entrust their lives to me. I don’t like that pressure but I still took the challenge. But of course, I didn’t tell them about the fact that I never drove before.

When we were about to go on the highway, people were already so scared of the experience in my car. The make-up artist stepped up and offered nicely if I didn’t mind her driving. I sensed a huge relief and willingness from the passengers. “Well, sure.”, I told the makeup artist unwillingly.

### Making a Musical in 48 Hours!
Almost two years soon passed in Toronto, and it was time for another 48 Hour Film Project. And I decided that’ll be my last time doing this as a producer. Next year I’ll try to direct myself.

We kept the core team the same. In fact, during that time, my main job was very draining and I couldn’t help but feel not able to focus very well on the competition. But thankfully, this time we got four producers in total so the work was much lighter.

I was so surprised that one of the producers, Avery, somehow got a location from a contact from his last short film - it’s a huge, beautiful office that we can use for a very low price. But at the same time, I’m not sure how can we use it as the story is completely unknown yet.

On the day of the competition, I went there supposedly together with Brayen, one of the directors. But the guy told me he’d be 30 minutes late! Every team needs to draw a random genre from a hat. The competition staff were pressuring me to draw the genre now. But my friend was still not there! I don’t want all this pressure to fall on me. What if I draw a bad one? 

Another 10 minutes passed and my friend was still not there. I realized if I don’t draw it now I’ll have much fewer options later. So here we go. I fumbled in the hat for a long time, praying to get a good one. When I saw what I drew, I was speechless. The first option was “Food Film”, and the other one was “Musical”. My heart sank. I felt the competition was already over. When I sent what I got to the group chat, not surprisingly everyone started complaining. I was the sinner who drew a musical out of everything that could be.

<img className="journey-image" id="musical-draw-img" src="/images/journey/MusicalDraw.webp" alt="film journey image"></img>

How the heck can we do a musical in 48 hours? When my director friend Brayden finally came to the location, we both agreed we’d have to do a food film. Something like Ratatouille? I was reckoning. 

At the same time, the writers are all at my place discussing about which genre to do. And surprisingly they want to go for Musical! One of the directors, Javi was also a writer and he says he is an undercover musician and he can compose songs. I highly doubt how good the songs are tho, at that moment. Even if let’s say we do have good songs? Who can sing for us?

Me and Brayden suddenly remembered a guy who applied to be an actor on our set. He doesn’t have too much acting experience but seems like a professional theatre singer. We didn’t write him back at the start. Now it seems like he’s the one. We gave him a call on the spot. Despite us not knowing if we’d for sure do a musical. Briskly, he said he was down and he’d quit his shift tomorrow to do it. 

The final elements we got were: A character - a professional chef, a prop - a poster card, and a line - “Well who knew”. Well, who knew we had a musical genre? When me and Brayden got to the writers’ room which is my house, the writers were discussing intensely. And Javi has got a guitar somewhere. 

They started talking about the musical idea - a desk jockey wants to become a professional chef but he doesn’t dare to quit his office job. A great combination of the location we got and the chef element. I was still not convinced. But then Javi started singing a theme song he just made for the story. Dang, it was quite catchy too! 

After throwing out some other ideas, we all agreed on the musical one. And here we go, we are doing a musical!

Also, for this film I had to commend our production designer Karan. Because we have only one day for production, we couldn’t have time to switch among different locations. At the same time, the story happens in three different settings: a kitchen, a living room, and an office. Karan used his PD magic - a bunch of second items from thrift stores and pulled this off convincingly. 

For this project, it was also a matter of fact that everything fell into its place. We had all the right people. Another cast for an important character, the chef, is a semi-professional singer too. The original DP flopped last second before the shoot and the new DP was just even more well-versed. 

Javi even composed two new songs on the spot while we were shooting. 

I genuinely felt happy for that set even though I was just the person connecting everyone together. Well, that’s also what a producer has to do.

Finally, the film went so well and it got into the top 15 out of the 108 teams that participated this year and won the Audience Choice award in our screening group.

Writing till here, I know that my filmmaking journey just embarked, and there will be more challenges coming over. I'm ready to say 'YES' to all the adventures in this film world.
