## My Filmmaking Journey
Ever since when I was in high school, it has always been my dream to become a film director. Throughout this journey of trying things out, I learnt so many things that I won't be able to get anywhere else. Therefore, I decided to write them down, in case it can inspire anybody else, or to help anyone to avoid the mistakes I made.

### Where it all started - 1998
Funny enough, I feel I am destined to have something to do with movies. When I was born, in the late nineties of southern China, my dad owned a DVD business - with a tiny twist that the DVDs were all pirated. So technically, I participated in an illegal organization as well. In fact, when I was a tiny kid I just lived with piles of DVDs in my room. Naturally all I did back then was to chip in the DVDs in the machine and watched so many movies.

As I grew up I always felt so deeply connected with films. Every time when I went to the cinema it has always been the best time - that's when I could escape to a different world. But it wasn't until high school when I realized this is something I want to do as a profession.

### High School - My first short film
I have to thank my high school for my first short film. 

I went to a pretty awesome high school in Beijing, and we had a short film festival every year (that is very rare). In high school, everybody wanted to be special. So was I. I thought I watched so many films, why not make one myself? 

I quickly wrote a script without any idea of the correct format. The story was a parody of The Fight Club, to express my frustration with the highly competitive education system in China. I was more fearless back then, which is something very precious. There were fewer distractions during that time. If I want to do something, I’ll do it. 

I had completely zero filmmaking experience back then. Once I started, I realized I was a little too ambitious. I had 21 days to figure out a film that was about 20 minutes long. I read basic theories, learned to set up a camera, tried editing with Premiere, and started fumbling my way there.

The most challenging part was how I heard so many voices of questioning - almost everyone told me that I would fail. I heard things like “The story was not good”, and “You have no experience. Why do it?” all the time.

My cameraman quit in the middle because he thought I was too stubborn with my opinions. It quickly became just me by myself with a camera and some actors. **But I never easily give up.** I still had my lead actor who always trusted me and backed me up. 

Of course, just like any film project, I was also distressed during the process. I remember I was holding tears when editing the film past midnight alone while my dad was shouting at me saying that ‘I was wasting my time’.

One day before the festival submission, I finished the film and had the film screened in my classroom. To my utmost surprise, everyone loved it so much - I remembered laughter coming from everywhere in the classroom as they were watching. It is still a memory that I remember till now. 

Later on, the film was sent to a film festival for high school students in Beijing and it won the Best Film.

**Lessons Learnt:**

- Voices of questioning will always come. Sometimes you just need the gut to fight till the end.

- Filmmaking is a very practical craft. The best way to learn is just by doing it. Even if it's just a camera and some actors it's still a good practice. I wished I had done more of these low cost short films back then.

- The best story is something that only you can tell - something coming from your heart.

### A Period Of Absolutely Nothing Done 
Later on, as I entered university, I regret until today that I did completely nothing regarding filmmaking for around 3 years. 

I wanted to go to a film school. Despite lots of arguments with my dad, I gave in and did a Computer Science degree. I was so occupied with the single goal of getting a higher GPA for a master's degree, therefore I gave up my time on many other things. 

When I think back, I realized nothing is important enough to make you ignore other aspects of your life. 

### Setting Up A Filmmaking Club - A heartbreaking experience
Despite that, my filmmaking dream was always at the back of my mind. 

Later, I transferred to a Canadian university. When I entered the school, I noticed that there was no filmmaking club. So I thought, why can’t I start a new one? 

My idea was simple - gather a group of friends to practice filmmaking regularly. Soon I realized the clubs in my university had a bunch of predefined rules and roles that were far too complex.

With my passion, I quickly attracted many co-founders. However, I really had no sense of leadership. Just like when making my first short film, I was a driven individual but a very bad leader. 

At that time, all I wanted was to push my agenda, FAST. I wasn’t considerate of my coworkers’ schedule and capacity. I didn’t take the time to find the right person to take the right position. I didn’t know how to encourage a collaborative discussion… I completely messed up, a big time. Slowly, I couldn’t help but feel so helpless. It seems like no one in the core team was behind me anymore. 

I still remember one day, I opened up to one team member -- I asked for some feedback on what I did wrong. Later past midnight, he wrote an essay of at least 1000 words recounting all of my mistakes. What’s more, on another day two core team members (out of 5 in total) quit the team. Not only that, before quitting, they also left some horrible criticisms publicly in the group chat. Basically, it expressed something like “bye and screw you.”

All of the criticisms made me completely devastated. On top of that, 2 months after the club started, COVID hit. How can I do a filmmaking club when there is a worldwide lockdown?

Feeling beaten up, I resigned from the leadership position and someone else in the team took it. It was quite humiliating. I always joke to myself - Steve Jobs also got fired from the company he created.

When I got the time, I sat down and carefully thought about all the mistakes I made. I looked up all the resources about “leadership” and realized if I were to do it again what I’d do differently. 

Later on, despite not having the title, I still stayed in the club and pushed it forward. We invited one of the directors from the Boys to speak at our club, did a panel with industry professionals, and created online screenwriting workshops. In the end, I couldn’t believe the school even gave this club an award.

Even though this was not ‘filmmaking’, thinking back, all of these experiences made me a much better film producer in the future.

**Lessons Learnt (not really about filmmaking):**
Delegate effectively. Let team members have a sense of ownership for their work. 

When making any team, always take the time to find the right person to take the right position.

Careful planning and a clear definition of duty with the team is far more important than blindly moving forward.

Never micromanage. “Don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with the results.”- Phil Knight (Nike founder)

People and tasks are all important. Find the balance when the team is happy and the job is also getting done.

### My second short film - Another humbling experience
Towards the end of my university, I thought to myself that I had to do another short film before graduation. The shitshow begins right here.

Because I didn’t do any film for like 4 years, I figured I had to make this one GREAT. Quickly, I wrote a story that is about a tiny girl who wants to learn how to make latte art and somehow winds up carrying out a heist of milk from a coffee shop. The story was 16 pages. I thought, umm, this is a story full of action, suspense, and humor - a formula of success. And me, as an award-winning director, will do a great job. 

I have to commend myself for the preproduction of this project. I took on the producer role as well - which later on proved to be not very wise. I found very amazing student crew members easily from my school. The DP even offered all the equipment needed. 

But the most difficult parts were to find A: a coffee shop to shoot at that also has a specific structure I needed for the story, B: a girl and a boy around 10 years old who can play siblings.

I remember how daunting I felt for both of these tasks. There was one day that I perked up the courage and started visiting a bunch of coffee shops in Montreal to see if they could let us shoot. On a beautiful hot summer day, I visited 4 or 5 coffee shops. They either didn’t work or rejected the proposal plainly. 

When I felt very discouraged, I visited the last one on my list. Visually, that one looked perfect! I started talking with the barista working there. To my utmost surprise,  she was a film studies student from my school! When I told her about making a film in the coffee shop, her eyes lit up. She said she wanted to help, but I’d still have to convince the owner - a French lady who doesn’t speak much English. 

When I got home, I phoned the owner. “Bonjour?”. Feeling so nervous, I started talking using my very broken French. After my explanation, I couldn’t believe the owner immediately responded “Oui!” (Yes) and a bunch of other things I didn’t understand. But what I could understand is that she could even offer the place to us for free - as long as it’s after their business hours. However, there was one more condition, she still needed us to get a third party liability insurance that costed 500$. That was the first time I realized how insurance can be a very annoying yet important factor in your filmmaking process.

Later on, I felt discouraged again, when I was trying to find the kids. The casting call I posted on the Facebook group was so underwhelming. The only candidate that looked great also ghosted me soon. In the audition, there was a girl, Sarah, who was great. But where could I find a brother for her? 

When I was looking at the candidates’ emails in despair. I suddenly noticed the profile photo of Sarah’s mom - there is another little girl who’s probably Sarah’s sister. Why don’t I change the little boy character to a girl? I called the mom and she immediately agreed to bring both of her daughters to our set.

But I remembered as it was getting closer to the shooting day, I was already feeling tired. At the same time, I was still pumped to make this the best film ever. I wanted all the shots possible and there were a whopping 100 shots I remember in the shot list. That was a huge mistake.

Every day, we had only 3 hours at the coffee shop - from the closing 5 pm till 8 pm the sun sets. We were making a heist film but our shoot actually felt more like a heist, especially when I had 100 shots to do.

At the same time, I was over-optimistic about the situation. My mindset was still staying on the time when I was doing the first short film - just a camera and some actors. But this time with camera, sound, light, and focus pulling…, every shot takes so much longer to do. The boom can mess up the shot or the focus can be wrong. There were all kinds of unexpected things that I had no clue about. 

When the shoot had to pause because of all these random issues, everybody would look at me, a complete rookie, for an answer. That stress was immense. When I didn’t know the answer, I began to stutter out of nervousness. Then I gave wrong instructions, everyone would become more frustrated. I hate that feeling - letting everyone down. 

I remember after the first night, I was so stressed out. I literally sat down in a McDonald's alone for one hour with a big soda and a brain completely blanked out. Also, that night, when we were transporting the equipment back to the DP’s home. We forgot one bag full of equipment that’s worth at least 1500$. That made me feel even worse.

I still couldn’t believe that the shoot lasted 9 days - that means 9 days of chaos. At the end of it, I was getting more and more towards the point of breaking down. After one of the last few days, it was late at night when I was waiting for the bus with a crew member. He had autism issues and he was also tired. He started blurting out numerous things I did wrong and reminded me of many basic things that know I should do. On top of all of the frustrations from everyone, I suddenly felt extremely helpless. I cut him off and shouted, “I’m also a human being alright? You don’t need to tell me what to do.” He stopped talking and was completely in shock. Later, he told me how hurt he felt hearing that especially as a person with autism. 

The next day, I apologized to him. Instead of accepting it, he eloquently recounted all of my mistakes and said how disappointed by me he was. Many times after, I tried to reconcile with him. We finally did but he said, “We’d never be friends again.”

The next morning, I called the DP asking if we could go over the shot list again and he shouted at me over the phone, saying what’s the point of going through something so simple. I was left speechless. I understood he was very frustrated by the whole thing. Before the shoot, he calmed down and pulled me aside. Peacefully he told me, “Including me, I guess most people will never want to work with you again.” That sentence stabbed me so hard at that moment. 

Thinking back, the two persons who helped me most actually were most disappointed in me. 

After the last day finished, I became depressed for at least two weeks. I felt I could accomplish nothing. After the depression faded away, I realized how much I lacked in terms of the basic skills in terms of film directing.

I’m still very thankful for that experience. The failures come early means I can start learning early.

**Lessons Learnt:**

- If I were to do it again, I wouldn’t try to upscale so fast. Learning a craft takes patience. Results come along after the accumulation of efforts on the long-term.

- Always take the pride/ego away. Otherwise, failures will be more heartbreaking.

- There will always be unexpected things happening. Give the important and complex shots more time. (20-30 minutes at least for an indie set). 

- In terms of filmmaking, a basic skill is to break down a scene into effective shots (coverage). It’s important to practice this and learn to prioritize. It’s OK to want more fancier shots but usually, you just need a few to tell the story well. 

- When directing, it’s important to think clearly about the performance you need from each actor, even for the minor roles. Anybody might ask you, ‘What should I do?’. On top of that, explain the blocking to the crew with clarity.

- Nervousness is a big enemy. The only way to defeat that is by trying more and getting more familiar with the craft. Even when you are nervous, try to speak with clarity and slowly so that communication is effective

- Directing actors is something I should learn about more.

- This might sound very basic, try to avoid producing and directing together. They are both very tenuous tasks.

### Toronto - a brand new start
After all the shitty experience in Montreal, I desperately needed a change. After graduation, I found a job in Toronto as a software developer and I immediately moved.

### 48 Hour Film Project
A brand new start means everything has to start from zero again. That’s something I’m not afraid of.

Usually, we tend to wait for a great idea to appear in our brain like a bolt of lightning that strikes. But this rarely happens. In fact, if you keep waiting, thinking you might do it one day you might put it off forever. I know I’m exactly like that.

So I thought the best way to kickstart my film career in Toronto was to participate in a competition. A deadline is always the best motivator. After looking online, I found out about 48 Hour Film Project - in which you write, shoot, and edit a film in just two days. This is a competition that I recommend every filmmaker to practice with.

After my big failure in directing the last short film, I decided not to direct this one, instead, to be a producer and find some directors to work with so I could learn from them. 

20 days before the competition, I started building the team. The first person was Noah, just a guy I know from my church who is a writer. Then I started posting in the Facebook groups for all the key members. In Toronto, talented people are everywhere. The crew members joined one by one. As we were getting closer to the date, we were still missing a DP. I was getting a little bit anxious about that.

All of a sudden, one day a French guy from Paris reached out to me on Instagram. To this day, I don’t know how he found me. This guy, Ozzy, seems like a very sick videographer. So I asked straight ahead if he’d like to help out with our 48-hour film. He happily said yes and I couldn’t believe that he owned a RED V-Raptor camera (at least 40,000$ worth) and tons of other gear. When I gave him a call, I found out he was in Paris. So he actually flew over to Toronto 2 days before the shoot and brought in a studio of equipment on the day of.

Two weeks before the competition, I got a heavy cold which I later knew was Covid. With a heavy fever, my brain was getting delusional. I somehow still managed to arrange the shoot, all thanks to the things I learned in Montreal.

Even tho the product we made wasn’t the best, we definitely had lots of fun doing this competition. It made me very glad that some of the cast said “This was the safest environment I’d felt on a film set”. That meant a lot to me as I wanted to do a better job than how it was for Latte Art.
