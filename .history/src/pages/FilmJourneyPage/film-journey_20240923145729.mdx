## My Filmmaking Journey
Ever since when I was in high school, it has always been my dream to become a film director. Throughout this journey of trying things out, I learnt so many things that I won't be able to get anywhere else. Therefore, I decided to write them down, in case it can inspire anybody else, or to help anyone to avoid the mistakes I made.

### Where it all started - 1998
