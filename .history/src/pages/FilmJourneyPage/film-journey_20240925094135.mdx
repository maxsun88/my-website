## My Filmmaking Journey
Ever since when I was in high school, it has always been my dream to become a film director. Throughout this journey of trying things out, I learnt so many things that I won't be able to get anywhere else. Therefore, I decided to write them down, in case it can inspire anybody else, or to help anyone to avoid the mistakes I made.

### Where it all started - 1998
Funny enough, I feel I am destined to have something to do with movies. When I was born, in the late nineties of southern China, my dad owned a DVD business - with a tiny twist that the DVDs were all pirated. So technically, I participated in an illegal organization as well. In fact, when I was a tiny kid I just lived with piles of DVDs in my room. Naturally all I did back then was to chip in the DVDs in the machine and watched so many movies.

As I grew up I always felt so deeply connected with films. Every time when I went to the cinema it has always been the best time - that's when I could escape to a different world. But it wasn't until high school when I realized this is something I want to do as a profession.
