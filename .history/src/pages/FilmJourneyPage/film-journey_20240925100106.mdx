## My Filmmaking Journey
Ever since when I was in high school, it has always been my dream to become a film director. Throughout this journey of trying things out, I learnt so many things that I won't be able to get anywhere else. Therefore, I decided to write them down, in case it can inspire anybody else, or to help anyone to avoid the mistakes I made.

### Where it all started - 1998
Funny enough, I feel I am destined to have something to do with movies. When I was born, in the late nineties of southern China, my dad owned a DVD business - with a tiny twist that the DVDs were all pirated. So technically, I participated in an illegal organization as well. In fact, when I was a tiny kid I just lived with piles of DVDs in my room. Naturally all I did back then was to chip in the DVDs in the machine and watched so many movies.

As I grew up I always felt so deeply connected with films. Every time when I went to the cinema it has always been the best time - that's when I could escape to a different world. But it wasn't until high school when I realized this is something I want to do as a profession.

### High School - My first short film
I have to thank my high school for my first short film. 

I went to a pretty awesome high school in Beijing, and we had a short film festival every year (that is very rare). In high school, everybody wanted to be special. So was I. I thought I watched so many films, why not make one myself? 

I quickly wrote a script without any idea of the correct format. The story was a parody of The Fight Club, to express my frustration with the highly competitive education system in China. I was more fearless back then, which is something very precious. There were fewer distractions during that time. If I want to do something, I’ll do it. 

I had completely zero filmmaking experience back then. Once I started, I realized I was a little too ambitious. I had 21 days to figure out a film that was about 20 minutes long. I read basic theories, learned to set up a camera, tried editing with Premiere, and started fumbling my way there.

The most challenging part was how I heard so many voices of questioning - almost everyone told me that I would fail. I heard things like “The story was not good”, and “You have no experience. Why do it?” all the time.

My cameraman quit in the middle because he thought I was too stubborn with my opinions. It quickly became just me by myself with a camera and some actors. **But I never easily give up.** I still had my lead actor who always trusted me and backed me up. 

Of course, just like any film project, I was also distressed during the process. I remember I was holding tears when editing the film past midnight alone while my dad was shouting at me saying that ‘I was wasting my time’.

One day before the festival submission, I finished the film and had the film screened in my classroom. To my utmost surprise, everyone loved it so much - I remembered laughter coming from everywhere in the classroom as they were watching. It is still a memory that I remember till now. 

Later on, the film was sent to a film festival for high school students in Beijing and it won the Best Film.

**Lessons Learnt:**

- Voices of questioning will always come. Sometimes you just need the gut to fight till the end.

- Filmmaking is a very practical craft. The best way to learn is just by doing it. Even if it's just a camera and some actors it's still a good practice. I wished I had done more of these low cost short films back then.

- The best story is something that only you can tell - something coming from your heart.

### A Period Of Absolutely Nothing Done 
Later on, as I entered university, I regret until today that I did completely nothing regarding filmmaking for around 3 years. 

I wanted to go to a film school. Despite lots of arguments with my dad, I gave in and did a Computer Science degree. I was so occupied with the single goal of getting a higher GPA for a master's degree, therefore I gave up my time on many other things. 

When I think back, I realized nothing is important enough to make you ignore other aspects of your life. 

### Setting Up A Filmmaking Club - A heartbreaking experience
Despite that, my filmmaking dream was always at the back of my mind. 

Later, I transferred to a Canadian university. When I entered the school, I noticed that there was no filmmaking club. So I thought, why can’t I start a new one? 

My idea was simple - gather a group of friends to practice filmmaking regularly. Soon I realized the clubs in my university had a bunch of predefined rules and roles that were far too complex.

With my passion, I quickly attracted many co-founders. However, I really had no sense of leadership. Just like when making my first short film, I was a driven individual but a very bad leader. 

At that time, all I wanted was to push my agenda, FAST. I wasn’t considerate of my coworkers’ schedule and capacity. I didn’t take the time to find the right person to take the right position. I didn’t know how to encourage a collaborative discussion… I completely messed up, a big time. Slowly, I couldn’t help but feel so helpless. It seems like no one in the core team was behind me anymore. 

I still remember one day, I opened up to one team member -- I asked for some feedback on what I did wrong. Later past midnight, he wrote an essay of at least 1000 words recounting all of my mistakes. What’s more, on another day two core team members (out of 5 in total) quit the team. Not only that, before quitting, they also left some horrible criticisms publicly in the group chat. Basically, it expressed something like “bye and screw you.”

All of the criticisms made me completely devastated. On top of that, 2 months after the club started, COVID hit. How can I do a filmmaking club when there is a worldwide lockdown?

Feeling beaten up, I resigned from the leadership position and someone else in the team took it. It was quite humiliating. I always joke to myself - Steve Jobs also got fired from the company he created.

When I got the time, I sat down and carefully thought about all the mistakes I made. I looked up all the resources about “leadership” and realized if I were to do it again what I’d do differently. 

Later on, despite not having the title, I still stayed in the club and pushed it forward. We invited one of the directors from the Boys to speak at our club, did a panel with industry professionals, and created online screenwriting workshops. In the end, I couldn’t believe the school even gave this club an award.

Even though this was not ‘filmmaking’, thinking back, all of these experiences made me a much better film producer in the future.

**Lessons Learnt (not really about filmmaking):**
Delegate effectively. Let team members have a sense of ownership for their work. 

When making any team, always take the time to find the right person to take the right position.

Careful planning and a clear definition of duty with the team is far more important than blindly moving forward.

Never micromanage. “Don't tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with the results.”- Phil Knight (Nike founder)

People and tasks are all important. Find the balance when the team is happy and the job is also getting done.

### My second short film - Another humbling experience
Towards the end of my university, I thought to myself that I had to do another short film before graduation. The shitshow begins right here.

Because I didn’t do any film for like 4 years, I figured I had to make this one GREAT. Quickly, I wrote a story that is about a tiny girl who wants to learn how to make latte art and somehow winds up carrying out a heist of milk from a coffee shop. The story was 16 pages. I thought, umm, this is a story full of action, suspense, and humor - a formula of success. And me, as an award-winning director, will do a great job. 

I have to commend myself for the preproduction of this project. I took on the producer role as well - which later on proved to be not very wise. I found very amazing student crew members easily from my school. The DP even offered all the equipment needed. 

But the most difficult parts were to find A: a coffee shop to shoot at that also has a specific structure I needed for the story, B: a girl and a boy around 10 years old who can play siblings.

I remember how daunting I felt for both of these tasks. There was one day that I perked up the courage and started visiting a bunch of coffee shops in Montreal to see if they could let us shoot. On a beautiful hot summer day, I visited 4 or 5 coffee shops. They either didn’t work or rejected the proposal plainly. 

When I felt very discouraged, I visited the last one on my list. Visually, that one looks perfect! I started talking with the barista working there. To my utmost surprise,  she was a film studies student from my school! When I told her about making a film in the coffee shop, her eyes lit up. She said she wanted to help, but I’d still have to convince the owner - a French lady who doesn’t speak much English. 

When I got home, I phoned the owner. “Bonjour?”. Feeling so nervous, I started talking using my very broken French. After my explanation, I couldn’t believe the owner immediately responded “Oui!” (Yes) and a bunch of other things I didn’t understand. But what I could understand is that she could even offer the place to us for free - as long as it’s after their business hours. However, there was one more condition, she still needed us to get a third party liability insurance that costed 500$. That was the first time I realized how insurance can be a very annoying yet important factor in your filmmaking process.
